Welcome to my Python Technical Tests Repository!

# PythonTestLab
"This repository contains Python technical tests I've created during my job search journey."

This repository contains a collection of technical tests and challenges that I have developed during my job search process. These tests cover various aspects of Python programming, including fundamental concepts, algorithms, data structures, and more.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills and proficiency in Python programming to potential employers. Additionally, it serves as a resource for candidates and enthusiasts to practice their Python skills and enhance their understanding of the language.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- Python Tests: Within this directory, you will find five Python tests, each in its own subdirectory. Each subdirectory contains my solution and development for the respective test, along with any additional files necessary to run it.

- General and SQL Tests: This directory contains other tests covering general questions and some related to the SQL language. Similar to the Python tests directory, each test is located in its own subdirectory and comes with my corresponding answer or development, as well as any relevant files for execution.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the different tests and challenges in this repository. You can use them for various purposes:

- Practicing your Python programming skills
- Preparing for technical interviews
- Assessing your understanding of specific Python concepts
- Adapting the tests for use in your own hiring process (with appropriate attribution)

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any suggestions for new tests or improvements to existing ones, feel free to submit a pull request.
